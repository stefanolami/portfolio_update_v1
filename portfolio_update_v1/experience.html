      <p>I have done many jobs in my life, starting at 14, working one month every summer during the school break. I have worked in many different kind of Factories, in the countryside, as a cleaner and even more. Until the age of 20 when I started getting inside my first kitchen, with my father (also a Chef) on my side sharing his knowledge with me, I have then attended a private cooking school, and after that I have started my 10 years long Chef career. I quit in september 2020, starting working with a friend in a musictape production studio in Berlin, and meanwhile looking for a new area to devote my future to, which I have finally happily found!</p>
